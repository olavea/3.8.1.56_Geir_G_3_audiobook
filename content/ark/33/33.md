3. Download files without your browser
If you've got the URL of a file you need to download, but don't want to download it in Safari, Chrome, or Firefox, Terminal can help. It needs just two commands - one to set Terminal's location to your Downloads folder (or anywhere else you want to put the downloaded file) and one to download the file. To set the location, use the command below. Change 'Downloads' to a different folder if you want to, remembering that if it's not in the first level of your user directory, you'll have to type the full path - or drag the folder on to the Terminal window.

cd ~/Downloads/

To download the file:

curl -O [the URL of the file]
-->
